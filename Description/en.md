This script provides an auto-play function for videos on [monsnode.com](https://monsnode.com) by automatically clicking the video URL on the destination `video.twimg.com` page when a video is opened.

## Features

- When a video is selected on [monsnode.com](https://monsnode.com), it automatically clicks the video URL link on the destination `video.twimg.com` page and automatically removes the transition page.
- Videos on `video.twimg.com` are automatically played.
- Videos start playing muted, but you can unmute by clicking on the screen, and you can also toggle mute ON/OFF using the `0` key.
